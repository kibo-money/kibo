/**
 * Nodes for constructing a graph of reactive values and reactive computations.
 *
 * - The graph is acyclic.
 * - The user inputs new values into the graph by calling .write() on one more computation nodes.
 * - The user retrieves computed results from the graph by calling .read() on one or more computation nodes.
 * - The library is responsible for running any necessary computations so that .read() is up to date
 *   with all prior .write() calls anywhere in the graph.
 * - We call the input nodes 'roots' and the output nodes 'leaves' of the graph here.
 * - Changes flow from roots to leaves. It would be effective but inefficient to immediately
 *   propagate all changes from a root through the graph to descendant leaves. Instead, we defer
 *   change most change propagation computation until a leaf is accessed. This allows us to
 *   coalesce computations and skip altogether recalculating unused sections of the graph.
 * - Each computation node tracks its sources and its observers (observers are other
 *   elements that have this node as a source). Source and observer links are updated automatically
 *   as observer computations re-evaluate and call get() on their sources.
 * - Each node stores a cache state (clean/check/dirty) to support the change propagation algorithm:
 *
 * In general, execution proceeds in three passes:
 *
 *  1. write() propagates changes down the graph to the leaves
 *     direct children are marked as dirty and their deeper descendants marked as check
 *     (no computations are evaluated)
 *  2. read() requests that parent nodes updateIfNecessary(), which proceeds recursively up the tree
 *     to decide whether the node is clean (parents unchanged) or dirty (parents changed)
 *  3. updateIfNecessary() evaluates the computation if the node is dirty (the computations are
 *     executed in root to leaf order)
